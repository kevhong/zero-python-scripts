## Zero Python Scripts

 I wrote these scripts to analyze the logs on transactions access and page recovery information I obtained from the Zero transaction manger. It allowed me to better understand how to improve instant recovery and restart.

Must be run in the scripts folder

Outputs will be put in the 'outputs' folder
